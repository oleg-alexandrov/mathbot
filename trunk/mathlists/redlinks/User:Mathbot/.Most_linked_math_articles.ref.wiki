This is a list of mathematics articles which are most linked to from other mathematics articles (that's the number on the right).

The point of this list is that the more linked to an article is, the more important it probably is, and the more crucial is for it to be in good shape.

Also, articles which are not yet in [[Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Mathematics articles by quality]] are pointed out.
