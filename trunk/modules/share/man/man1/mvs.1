.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\f(CW\*(C`mvs\*(C'\fR is a command line client whose purpose is to simplify offline
editing of Wiki content.  It allows you to get any number of pages from a
given Mediawiki site, edit the pages with any editor, get and merge any
concurrent updates of the pages, and then safely commit the users own
changes back to the version of the page on the server.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`mvs\*(C'\fR commands which take a filename argument only accept a single
filename as so to avoid taking up too much server bandwidth.
.SH "QUICKSTART"
.IX Header "QUICKSTART"
.Sh "Step 1:  Create an account on the Mediawiki server."
.IX Subsection "Step 1:  Create an account on the Mediawiki server."
This should be done the normal way, by visiting the mediawiki website to
which you want to contribute and creating a new account, setting the
preferences, etc.
.PP
It should hopefully go without saying that you will want to become familiar
with the editorial, usage, and copyright guidelines of the site.  You
should probably also make some contributions through the normal \s-1UI\s0, and
learn about following recent changes before contributing using mvs.
.PP
In addition for the sake of this test you should already have a user page
like User:<username> with something on it, where <username> is the user
name with which you estabilished the account.
.Sh "Step 2:  Create a working directory"
.IX Subsection "Step 2:  Create a working directory"
Wix works with mediawiki formatted files with a \f(CW\*(C`.wiki\*(C'\fR extension and
which are stored together with server information in a \fIworking directory\fR.  
You will have to have \fIat least\fR one working directory for each Mediawiki
site to which you contribute.
.PP
Simply use \f(CW\*(C`mkdir\*(C'\fR or the equivalent to make a new directory, and then
before cd into that directory.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  mkdir wikitravel.en
\&  cd wikitravel.en
.Ve
.PP
All of the operations below should be done from this directory.
.ie n .Sh "Step 3:  Login using ""mvs login"""
.el .Sh "Step 3:  Login using \f(CWmvs login\fP"
.IX Subsection "Step 3:  Login using mvs login"
To use login you will need to know the \fIsite_url\fR for the Mediawiki site
to which you want to contribute.  This will simply be the regular \s-1URL\s0 for
the site, with any language path extension.  For instance for the english
version of Wikitravel I would use the \fIsite_url\fR
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  http://www.wikitravel.org/en
.Ve
.PP
Now use the \fIsite_url\fR with your username and password to login.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  mvs -d http://www.wikitravel.org/en -u <username> -p 'secret' login
.Ve
.PP
Now anything you submit to the Mediawiki server will be credited to user
\&\*(L"<username>\*(R".
.ie n .Sh "Step 4:  Use ""mvs update"" to fetch one or more working files"
.el .Sh "Step 4:  Use \f(CWmvs update\fP to fetch one or more working files"
.IX Subsection "Step 4:  Use mvs update to fetch one or more working files"
You can fetch existing material off of the site, or create new pages with
\&\f(CW\*(C`mvs update\*(C'\fR, remembering that your files will need a \f(CW\*(C`.wiki\*(C'\fR extension:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  mvs update User:<username>.wiki User:<username>/Test_Page.wiki
.Ve
.PP
This should produce the output:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  U User:<username>.wiki
\&  A User:<username>/Test_Page.wiki
.Ve
.PP
The U (for Updated) means that User:<username> was found on the server and
its contents inserted into the local files.  The A (for Added) means that
the User:<username>/Test_Page.wiki page does not yet exist on the server,
and will be added when you run \f(CW\*(C`mvs commit\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Note that both of the pages we are working with are within \fIyour\fR
User Namespace.  It's probably a good idea to restrict yourself to working
with such pages while you are experimenting with \f(CW\*(C`mvs\*(C'\fR
.Sh "Step 5:  Edit the files to make corrections and contributions"
.IX Subsection "Step 5:  Edit the files to make corrections and contributions"
Use your favorite text editor to edit the files.  You might want to check
out this page to see if there is a Mediawiki syntax highlighting file for
your editor:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Syntax_highlighting
.Ve
.PP
Of course if you don't find a highlighting file for you editor you are
welcome to create one and submit it to the page above.
.ie n .Sh "Step 6:  Use ""mvs commit"" to submit your changes"
.el .Sh "Step 6:  Use \f(CWmvs commit\fP to submit your changes"
.IX Subsection "Step 6:  Use mvs commit to submit your changes"
When you are done editing a file and would like to submit your changes to
the wiki server use \f(CW\*(C`mvs commit\*(C'\fR to do so:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  mvs -m 'commit message' commit User:<username>.wiki
.Ve
.PP
Where 'commit message' is whatever you want to say about the changes you
are submitting and why.  You must provide a commit message or \f(CW\*(C`mvs commit\*(C'\fR
will fail.  You might also find that \f(CW\*(C`mvs commit\*(C'\fR fails complaining that
the file has changed on the server.  If this is the case you will need to
use \f(CW\*(C`mvs update\*(C'\fR again to get the most recent changes.
.Sh "Step 7: Update your wiki files"
.IX Subsection "Step 7: Update your wiki files"
You can use \f(CW\*(C`mvs update\*(C'\fR again at any time to reconcile any of your files
with the most recent changes from the server.  Your changes \fIwill not\fR be
overwritten, but rather \f(CW\*(C`mvs\*(C'\fR will try to merge any server changes into
the files as they exist in your working directory.  Note that update and
commit only work on one file at a time, as so to help prevent accidents and
server congestion.
.PP
If for some reason there is a conflict, ie. you and someone else have made
changes which appear to be incompatible, and cannot be resolved then your
file will contain a \fIconflict message\fR, as detailed in the documentation
for \f(CW\*(C`mvs update\*(C'\fR below.  You \fImust\fR resolve any conficts \fIbefore\fR
attempting to use \f(CW\*(C`mvs commit\*(C'\fR on the file.  This is usually a very simple
matter of choosing one version of the change or another.  You should use
your best judgement, consulting the relavant \f(CW\*(C`Talk:\*(C'\fR page to try to work
out an aggreement with the other contributor in cases where you just simply
disagree.
.Sh "Repeat"
.IX Subsection "Repeat"
You can continue editing and commiting changes with the files in your
working directory.  It might be a good idea for you to eventually create
multiple working directories per site, perhaps grouping them by subject.
This will work fine with \f(CW\*(C`mvs\*(C'\fR since it does \fInot\fR need to have a
complete copy of all of the pages from a given server in a given working
directory to work.
.SH "ARGUMENTS"
.IX Header "ARGUMENTS"
.Sh "Commands"
.IX Subsection "Commands"
The first argument after the options should be one of the following two
commands:
.IP "mvs login" 4
.IX Item "mvs login"
Allows the user to login to the Mediawiki server using an \fIexisting\fR login
and password for that server.  After calling \f(CW\*(C`login\*(C'\fR ll \f(CW\*(C`commit\*(C'\fRs from
the same working directory will be logged as from the logged-in user.
.IP "mvs update" 4
.IX Item "mvs update"
Updates the specified file[s] with content from the Mediawiki server.  If a
file does not exist it is created and populated with the current online
version.  If there is no online version, the file either created and left
blank, or just left as it is.  If there is content in both the specified
file and in the cooresponding Wiki page, an attempt is made to merge the
two, line by line.  Files which are the same as the server version are
ignored.
.Sp
If no filenames are given on the command line, all visible files with the
\&.wiki extension are processed.
.Sp
Conflicting changes to a given line are detected on the basis of the date
of the most recent update of the local file and date of the most recent
change to the online Wiki page.  If a line has changed in both the online
page and the local file it is flagged as a conflict, as in \s-1CVS\s0, but with a
slightly differnt syntax:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&  >>>>>> http://www.somewiki.org
\&  This is the version on the Wiki
\&  >>>>>> Paris.wiki
\&  This is the local version
\&  <<<<<<
.Ve
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`mvs update\*(C'\fR reports the status of files which it touches to stderr with
a letter indicating the file status, and then name of the file, again like
\&\s-1CVS\s0.  The status letters are:
.RS 4
.IP "A (Added)" 4
.IX Item "A (Added)"
The file will become a new page on the wiki server.
.IP "M (Modified)" 4
.IX Item "M (Modified)"
The file has been modified locally.
.IP "U (Updated)" 4
.IX Item "U (Updated)"
The file has been updated with changes from the wiki server.
.IP "C (Conflicts)" 4
.IX Item "C (Conflicts)"
The file contains conflict markers.
.RE
.RS 4
.RE
.IP "commit" 4
.IX Item "commit"
Commits any changes in the specified local files to the Wiki site.  A check
is made first to make sure that there are no changes on the server more
recent than the most recent update.  Files which are the same as the server
version are ignored.
.Sp
If no filenames are given on the command line, all visible files with the
\&.wiki extension are processed.
.Sp
When running \f(CW\*(C`mvs commit\*(C'\fR you \fImust\fR use the \f(CW\*(C`\-m\*(C'\fR flag to send a commit
message to the Mediawiki server.  eg:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  mvs -m 'Added Hotel Eldorado' commit Paris.wiki
.Ve
.Sh "File names"
.IX Subsection "File names"
Any additional arguments are taken as \fIlocal\fR filenames to be processed.
The local filename of a given Mediawiki page will be the same as its \s-1URL\s0
encoded name with the extension \*(L".wiki\*(R".  If no arguments are given then
any filenames with the \*(L"wiki\*(R" extension and under the current directory are
processed.
.SH "OPTIONS"

This is an early version of this program.  Future versions may have major
differences which will effect your ability to use them interchangably with
this one.  In particular the initial \*(L"command\*(R" arguments may become
options and the handling of conflicts might change dramatically.
