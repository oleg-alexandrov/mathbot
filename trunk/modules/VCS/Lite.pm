=head1 NAME

VCS::Lite - Minimal version control system

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use VCS::Lite;

  # diff

  my $lit = VCS::Lite->new('/home/me/foo1.txt');
  my $lit2 = VCS::Lite->new('/home/me/foo2.txt');
  my $difftxt = $lit->delta($lit2)->diff;
  print OUTFILE $difftxt;

  # patch

  my $delt = VCS::Lite::Delta->new('/home/me/patch.diff');
  my $lit3 = $lit->patch($delt);
  print OUTFILE $lit3->text;

  # merge

  my $lit4 = $lit->merge($lit->delta($lit2),$lit->delta($lit3));
  print OUTFILE $lit4->text;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides the functions normally associated with a version
control system, but without needing or implementing a version control
system. Applications include wikis, document management systems and
configuration management.

It makes use of the module Algorithm::Diff. It provides the facility
for basic diffing, patching and merging.

=head2 new

The underlying storage concept of VCS::Lite is an array. The members 
of the array can be anything that a scalar can represent (including
references to structures and objects). The default is for the object
to hold an array of scalars as strings corresponding to lines of text.

The basic form of the constructor is as follows:

  my $lite = VCS::Lite->new( '/my/file');

which slurps the file to make an object. The full form is as follows:

  my $lite = VCS::Lite->new( $object_id, $separation, $source, ...);

=over 4

=item C<$object_id>

This is a string to identify what is being diffed, patched or
merged, in the application's environment. If there is no $source, this 
is used as a filename from which to read the content.

=item C<$separation>

This is an optional parameter, which can be used via $/ to split the input
file into tokens. The default is for lines of text. If you pass in a string
to be tokenized, this will use $sep as a regular expression

$separation can be a scalar or scalar ref, where this is used to break
up the input stream. All values permitted for $/ are allowed (see L<perlvar>).

$separation can also be a hashref, to give a finer level of control. For example:

  {  in => '\n',
     out => '\n',
     chomp => 1 }

'in' is the input record separator to use (the same as you would pass as $sep).
Note that all values allowed for $/, and indeed the value of $/ passed in is
what is used as a default. 'in' can be a string or a regexp.

'out' is the character used on joining the members to output the results (text
method in scalar context). This is the output record separator $\. Note that
'out' defaults differently depening on the setting of 'chomp': if 'chomp' is
off, 'out' will default to the empty string, or rather the passed in value of
$\. If 'chomp' is on, 'out' will default to 'in' - note that you should 
specify 'out' explicitly if you are using a regexp for 'in'.

If the 'chomp' flag is set, the text matching 'in' is removed from the input
lines as they are read. 'chomp' is not on by default, as this is new 
functionality in release 0.08.

=item C<$source> 

if unspecified causes $object_id to be opened as a file and its
entire contents read in. The alternative is to supply $source, which can
be one of the following:

=over 4

=item C<scalar>

This is a string which is tokenized using $separation

=item C<arrayref>

Array of tokens

=item C<filehandle> or C<globref>

Contents of file are slurped

=item C<callback>

This is called successively to obtain tokens until received undef.

=back

=back

In the Perl spirit of DWIM, new assumes that given an arrayref, you
have already done all the work of making your list of whatevers. Given
a string (filename) or a file handle, the file is slurped, reading
each line of text into a member of the array. Given a callback, the
routine is called successively with arguments $p1, $p2, etc. and is
expected to return a scalar which is added (pushed on) to the array.

=head2 apply

  $lite->apply($lite2);
  $lite->apply($lite3, base => 'original');

This method call corresponds approximately to a version control system's
check-in function. This causes $lite to be modified, so that its contents
now reflect those of $lite2.

$lite does retain the original contents, available via L<original>. However,
unlike in a version control system, the object holds only the first original 
and latest contents.

The VCS::Lite object passed in can also have its own original version. If 
this is the case, merging will be performed to incorporate the change as if
it had come from a different branch. To facilitiate the merging process,
optionally specify a base version, which can be the string 'original', 
'contents' (the default) or a VCS::Lite object whose contents will be used.
This corresponds to the "common ancestor" in version control systems.

=head2 original

This returns a VCS::Lite object for the original version, before changes were
applied with apply.

=head2 text

  my $foo = $lite->text;
  my $bar = $lit2->text('|');
  my @baz = $lit3->text;

In scalar context, returns the equivalent of the file contents slurped
(the optional separation parameter, defaulting to $_, is used to join
the strings together). In list context, returns the list of lines or
records.

=head2 id

  my $fil = $lite->id

Returns the name associated with the VCS::Lite element when it was created
by new. This is usually the file name.

=head2 delta

  my $delt = $lit->delta($lit2);

Perform the difference between two VCS::Lite objects. This object returns
a L<VCS::Lite::Delta> object.

=head2 diff

This is for backward compatibility with early versions. $lite->diff($lite2) is 
equivalent to $lite->delta($lite2)->diff.

=head2 patch

  my $lit3 = $lit->patch($delt);

Applies a patch to a VCS::Lite object. Accepts a file handle or file
name string. Reads the file in diff format, and applies it. Returns a
VCS::Lite object for the patched source.

=head2 merge

  my $lit4 = $lit->merge($lit1,$lit2,\&confl);

Performs the "parallelogram of merging". This applies two different
change streams represented by VCS::Lite objects. Returns a VCS::Lite
object with both sets of changes merged.

The third parameter to the method is a sub which is called whenever a
merge conflict occurs. This needs to either resolve the conflict or
insert the necessary text to highlight the conflict.
